My solutions to CodeEval.com challenges

These challenges offer a nice opportunity to solve problems not of the sort I usually experience at work. I try look for challenges where I recognise the need to use std library functions or techniques that I'm not that familiar with as a learning opportunity. 

## [Challenge #14: String permutations](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/14/)
1. Generic way of for-each-line-in-file perform operation
2. std::next_permutation

## [Challenge 48: Discount offers (incomplete)](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/48/)
1. std::next_permutation
2. std::set_intersection
3. std::iota
